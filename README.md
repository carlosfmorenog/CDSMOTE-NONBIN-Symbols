# CDSMOTE-NONBIN-Symbols

An imbalance handling method to improve the detection and classification of symbols depicted in Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;IDs)

See `demo.ipynb` for a jupyter notebook demo on how to use this method.

The original symbol dataset can be downloaded from here:

abstract = {Engineering drawings are common across different domains such as Oil {\&} Gas, construction, mechanical and other domains. Auto- matic processing and analysis of these drawings is a challenging task. This is partly due to the complexity of these documents and also due to the lack of dataset availability in the public domain that can help push the research in this area. In this paper, we present a multiclass imbalanced dataset for the research community made of 2432 instances of engineering symbols. These symbols were extracted from a collection of complex engineering drawings known as Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P{\&}ID). By providing such dataset to the research community, we anticipate that this will help attract more attention to an important, yet overlooked industrial problem, and will also advance the research in such important and timely topics. We discuss the datasets characteristics in details, and we also show how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) perform on such extremely imbalanced datasets. Finally, conclusions and future directions are discussed.},
