# CDSMOTE-NONBIN-Symbols

An imbalance handling method to improve the detection and classification of symbols depicted in Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;IDs)

See `demo.ipynb` for a jupyter notebook demo on how to use this method.

The original symbol dataset can be downloaded from here:

The generated symbol dataset, once CDSMOTE has been applied, can be downloaded from here:
